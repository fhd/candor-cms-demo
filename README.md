Candor CMS Demo
===============

A demonstration of [Candor CMS](http://github.com/fhd/candor-cms).

Running the Demo
----------------

First you'll have to get both this demo and Candor CMS, best via Git:

	git clone git://github.com/fhd/candor-cms.git
	git clone git://github.com/fhd/candor-cms-demo.git
	
Then configure the absolute path to candor-cms-demo in the file
*src/main/resources/candorcms.properties* in the candor-cms directory.

Now refer to the candor-cms README file for instructions on how to run
it in a local server and open the URL in a browser. You should see the
demo website.
